# nvpair-node-info

A Go service that exposes this machine's hardware inventory (GPUs, CPU, physical memory) over a small HTTP API at `/v1/node-info`. It advertises nothing over mDNS itself — its parent (the broker) registers its `ni` port with the `nvpair-node-scanner` discovery daemon, which folds it into this node's single `_nvpair-node` record and fetches `/v1/node-info` to enrich the node for peers.

## Communication

Two surfaces:

- **HTTP(S)** — serves the node inventory at `/v1/node-info`. Plaintext HTTP on `:14318` by default; optional HTTPS (with optional mTLS) on `:14319` when a cert/key pair is supplied.
- **stdio JSON-RPC 2.0** — newline-delimited, used for lifecycle/control (`log/set-level`, `nodeinfo:set-cluster-identity`) and shutdown via stdin EOF. The service is normally launched as a subprocess by the broker.

It does **not** advertise itself over mDNS. Discovery is centralized in the `nvpair-node-scanner` daemon: the broker registers this service's `ni` port with the daemon, which carries it on the node's one `_nvpair-node` record and fetches `/v1/node-info` over plain HTTP to enrich each node.

## CLI Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port <n>` | `14318` | HTTP port to listen on |
| `--tls-port <n>` | `14319` | HTTPS port (only used when `--cert` and `--key` are set) |
| `--cert <path>` | _(none)_ | TLS server certificate (PEM); enables HTTPS when set together with `--key` |
| `--key <path>` | _(none)_ | TLS server private key (PEM); enables HTTPS when set together with `--cert` |
| `--client-ca <path>` | _(none)_ | PEM bundle of CAs trusted to sign client certificates; enables mTLS when set |
| `--accept-http` | `false` | Keep the plaintext HTTP listener alive even when TLS is enabled (default: HTTPS-only once `--cert` is set) |
| `--cluster-dir <path>` | _(none)_ | Cluster config dir (`node.crt`/`node.key` + `trusted/`); when set, the primary port carries one cluster-gated listener. While this node is a cluster member, `/v1/node-info` is served **only** over cluster-scoped pin-based mTLS, to pinned cluster peers — or this node itself via self-trust — and a plaintext caller is refused with `403`; while it is not a member the plaintext inventory is served as usual. Membership is re-read per request. Takes precedence over the `--cert` path |
| `--version` | | Print version and exit |

`--log-level` is also accepted (registered by `nvpair-shared/applog`).

### TLS / mTLS configuration

The cert flags follow a bring-your-own contract, validated at startup:

- `--cert` and `--key` must be supplied together; either alone is rejected.
- `--client-ca` requires `--cert` and `--key`. When set, the server requires and verifies a client certificate (`RequireAndVerifyClientCert`); connections without a trusted client cert are dropped at handshake time.
- TLS minimum version is pinned to TLS 1.2.

When TLS is enabled, the HTTP listener is dropped unless `--accept-http` is passed. Both listeners share the same handler, but bind separate ports so clients can migrate independently.

`--cluster-dir` replaces both with a single cluster-gated listener on the primary port (see the flag table): one bound port, both personalities, and the choice between them follows live cluster membership rather than being fixed when the listener was bound.

## HTTP API

### `GET /v1/node-info`

Returns the merged static identity (collected once at startup) and the latest dynamic stats snapshot.

}
```

Field notes:

- Dynamic fields (`vram_used_bytes`, `utilization_percent`, `cpu.utilization_percent`, `memory.used_bytes`) are populated by the Windows, Linux, and macOS per-tick stats collectors.
- `telemetryValid` and `msSince` describe the node-wide GPU utilization snapshot. `telemetryValid` is `true` after the collector has produced a usable GPU sample; `msSince` is that sample's age in milliseconds at response time. A failed collection retains the last usable sample and lets its age increase. Before the first usable sample, and on platforms without dynamic GPU telemetry, the response reports `telemetryValid:false` and `msSince:0`; consumers must ignore the age while validity is false.
- `clusterUuid` is the cluster principal this node currently holds. It has three distinct states on the wire: **absent** means unknown, **present and empty** means this node belongs to no cluster, and a value is that principal. A consumer must not read absent as unclustered — that is how a node too old to report the field answers, and also how this node answers before its parent has told it anything, so acting on it would clear a correct annotation elsewhere in the fleet.
- Under the broker, `clusterUuid` is pushed in over stdin (`nodeinfo:set-cluster-identity`) because node-info is spawned with no cluster dir and so cannot read membership itself; the field stays absent until the first push arrives. Standalone with `--cluster-dir`, it reads membership from the trust store per request instead and is therefore always known. The two sources are mutually exclusive by deployment, not a fallback chain.
- `clusterUuid` exists so a peer can learn this node's membership without its mDNS record. Membership otherwise travels only as the `cluster-uuid=` TXT key, which a consumer reads once per record *change*; a consumer that misses that change keeps the previous value indefinitely, and one still holding a departed node's principal will suppress the invite that would bring it back.
- `kind` is absent for a GPU and `"npu"` for a dedicated inference accelerator (an Edge TPU / NPU) that is listed in the same `GPUs` inventory so every client shows it. Accelerators cannot run the engines PAIR schedules, so consumers derive a node's GPU pressure with `noderec.MaxGPUUtilization`, which skips `kind:"npu"` rows, and an accelerator never contributes to `telemetryValid` / `msSince`.
- `temperature_celsius` is a device's thermal readout in whole degrees: on a GPU row from `nvidia-smi` (`temperature.gpu`, Linux and Windows; joined to the adapter by PCI address on Windows), on an accelerator row from its driver, and on `cpu` the package temperature from Linux hwmon (`coretemp` "Package id 0" / `k10temp` Tctl, else the `x86_pkg_temp` thermal zone). On Windows the package sensor is a ring-0 register, so the reading comes from the elevated `nvpair-sensors` service over `\\.\pipe\nvpair-sensors` (see `../nvpair-sensors/README.md`); a host without that service, without PawnIO, or with a stale report omits it. Every temperature field is omitted wherever it cannot be read.
- All dynamic fields and the `cpu` / `memory` objects use `omitempty`: a value the service couldn't read is dropped from the JSON entirely rather than reported as a misleading literal zero. A genuinely idle CPU renders the same as "unknown" — that ambiguity is intentional and benign.
- `vram_bytes` is reported through DXGI on Windows, `nvidia-smi` on Linux, and IORegistry on macOS. On a unified-memory NVIDIA GPU such as DGX Spark, Linux uses total physical system memory for `vram_bytes` and the independently sampled system-memory usage for `vram_used_bytes`. On Apple Silicon, `vram_bytes` is total physical unified memory and `vram_used_bytes` is the GPU driver's mapped allocation (`Alloc system memory`), not whole-system RAM usage or the momentarily active subset.

## Discovery

The service no longer advertises itself over mDNS. Its parent (the broker) registers the `ni` port with the `nvpair-node-scanner` discovery daemon, which carries it on this node's single `_nvpair-node` record; a peer's daemon then fetches `/v1/node-info` over plain HTTP to enrich the node. Transport is derived from the shared per-service policy (`nvpair-shared/noderec`): node-info is served plain on the broker path. The standalone BYO-TLS / `--cluster-dir` mTLS serving above is retained for running node-info on its own, but is unused under the broker.

## Platform Notes

- **Windows** (first-class): GPU inventory comes from DXGI (vendor-agnostic, includes VRAM). Dynamic CPU / VRAM-used / utilization / memory-used numbers come from a persistent PDH query plus `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`. GPU temperature comes from `nvidia-smi` on a 5 s poller, joined to each DXGI adapter through the display driver's PCI address (`D3DKMTQueryAdapterInfo` / `KMTQAITYPE_ADAPTERADDRESS`), so two identical cards never swap readings; a host without `nvidia-smi` reports none. The CPU package temperature is polled every 5 s from the `nvpair-sensors` service's named pipe (`nvpair-shared/hostsensors`): the sensor is a model-specific register that only the elevated helper can read through PawnIO. A report older than 30 s is dropped, an absent helper is retried every 30 s, and in both cases `cpu.temperature_celsius` is omitted.
- **Linux** (first-class): NVIDIA GPU inventory, dedicated VRAM usage, utilization and temperature come from `nvidia-smi`; CPU and system-memory usage come from `/proc`, the CPU package temperature from hwmon (`coretemp` / `k10temp` / `zenpower` / `cpu_thermal`, else the `x86_pkg_temp` thermal zone). Unified-memory GPUs use the `/proc/meminfo` system-memory snapshot even when dynamic `nvidia-smi` collection is unavailable. AMD adapters are read from amdgpu's sysfs nodes (see [Linux AMD (amdgpu sysfs)](#linux-amd-amdgpu-sysfs) below) with full capacity, usage, utilization and temperature; any remaining non-NVIDIA adapter falls back to names from `ghw` without dynamic GPU stats. Inference accelerators behind the gasket/apex driver (Google Coral Edge TPU, `/sys/class/apex/*`) are listed with `kind:"npu"`; the driver keeps no busy counter, so `utilization_percent` is the fraction of 100 ms sub-intervals in the last second in which the device's `interrupt_counts` moved (the same "percent of time working" definition as `nvidia-smi`'s `utilization.gpu`, at coarser resolution), and `temperature_celsius` comes from its `temp` attribute.
- **macOS**: CPU and system-memory usage come from Mach through gopsutil's purego bindings. GPU identity, mapped memory, and utilization come from the built-in, unprivileged `/usr/sbin/ioreg` command's `IOAccelerator` `PerformanceStatistics`; no sudo or private framework binding is required. Apple Silicon is supported directly. Intel/AMD fields are best-effort when their drivers expose the same dedicated-memory counters. The performance keys are undocumented and may change across macOS releases; a missing or changed key leaves only that metric out and does not stop CPU or memory collection.
- **Other platforms**: GPU names come from `ghw`; VRAM and dynamic stats are not reported.

### Windows inventory: stale DirectX registry at boot

DXGI enumeration is filtered against the `AdapterLuid` values under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DirectX`, which is how an RDP phantom clone of a card (same name, a second LUID) is kept out of the inventory. Windows reassigns adapter LUIDs on every boot but only rewrites those registry keys about a minute into the session, so a service that enumerates before that is matching this boot's LUIDs against the previous boot's: nothing matches, and the gate would drop every real adapter. That is not a state a machine with GPUs can be in, so an empty result is treated as proof the registry is stale — every adapter is kept and one warning is logged with the counts. When the gate keeps at least one adapter it still filters exactly as before.

Detection also runs again after startup, on its own goroutine, never on the 1 s stats tick. While the inventory is empty it retries **every 10 s** until adapters appear; once at least one is known it re-detects **every 60 s** and republishes only when the set of adapters changed (a card hot-plugged after startup, or a clone a remote session brought in). Recovered adapters carry the same LUID key the PDH counters and the `nvidia-smi` temperature join use, so their VRAM, utilization and temperature fill in on the next tick; the temperature poller resolves an adapter address it has not seen before on demand. A node that came up with an empty GPU list therefore repairs itself instead of needing a restart.

### Linux AMD (amdgpu sysfs)

AMD ships no `nvidia-smi` equivalent in a default install, so a Radeon host used to fall through to `ghw` and publish the PCI database's codename and nothing else (`{"name":"Barcelo"}`). The amdgpu driver already exposes everything needed under `/sys/class/drm/card<N>/device/`, world-readable, so the inventory and the per-tick sample are plain file reads — no daemon, no root, no cgo, no new dependency.

What is read, per card:

| attribute | use |
| --- | --- |
| `vendor`, `device` | vendor `0x1002` selects the card; the device id picks the marketing name |
| `uevent` (`PCI_SLOT_NAME`) | join-key fallback when the `device` symlink cannot be resolved |
| `mem_info_vram_total` | dedicated VRAM, or an APU's firmware carve-out |
| `mem_info_gtt_total` | the GTT aperture — system memory the GPU may map |
| `mem_info_vram_used`, `mem_info_gtt_used` | `vram_used_bytes`, sampled every collector tick |
| `gpu_busy_percent` | `utilization_percent`, already the 0..100 figure `nvidia-smi`'s `utilization.gpu` reports |
| `hwmon/hwmon<N>/temp*_input` + `temp*_label` | `temperature_celsius`, in millidegrees, from the sensor labelled `edge` |

Only `card<N>` directories are enumerated. The DRM class also carries one `card<N>-<CONNECTOR>` entry per output (`card1-DP-1`, `card1-HDMI-A-1`, …) and `renderD<N>` nodes, all pointing back at the same device; listing them would publish the same GPU several times.

**Unified-pool capacity rule.** On an APU `mem_info_vram_total` is only the carve-out the firmware reserved — 512 MiB on a Ryzen 5 5625U — while the real ceiling for a model is that carve-out plus the GTT aperture. So:

- **APU** (a device id in the built-in table, or `mem_info_vram_total` under 1 GiB alongside a `mem_info_gtt_total`): `vram_bytes = mem_info_vram_total + mem_info_gtt_total`, and `vram_used_bytes = mem_info_vram_used + mem_info_gtt_used`.
- **Discrete card**: `vram_bytes = mem_info_vram_total` and `vram_used_bytes = mem_info_vram_used` — a discrete card also exposes a GTT aperture, and counting it would inflate a 16 GiB card to 24 GiB.

Capacity and usage always come from the same side of that rule, so `vram_used_bytes` can never exceed `vram_bytes`. A unified AMD row is *not* the unified-memory NVIDIA case: that one substitutes whole-system RAM usage for a GPU whose driver cannot report its own, while amdgpu reports its own usage precisely and is always believed.

**Join key.** Each row's internal `statsKey` is `amd:<pci address>` — `amd:0000:04:00.0` — taken from resolving the `device` symlink into `/sys/bus/pci/devices`, or from `uevent`'s `PCI_SLOT_NAME`, or, as a last resort, the DRM node name (`amd:card1`). The key never reaches the wire; it exists so the static row and the collector's sample meet. The `amd:<pci>` spelling matches the upstream amdgpu inventory work, so both implementations key identically.

**Names.** A small table maps the device id to a marketing name (`0x15e7` → `AMD Radeon Graphics (Vega 7, Barcelo)`; Cezanne, Lucienne, Renoir, Picasso, Raven, Rembrandt, Phoenix and Strix are listed too). An unlisted id publishes `AMD Radeon Graphics (0x<id>)` — never a bare codename, and never a dropped row.

**Ceilings and caveats.**

- Requires the `amdgpu` kernel driver. The older `radeon` driver and pre-Vega parts expose none of these attributes; such a card keeps the `ghw` name-only behavior.
- `gpu_busy_percent` is the driver's own coarse busy figure, not per-engine and not per-process, and a few ASICs do not export it at all. A missing or out-of-range value is dropped rather than published as `0`, so a driver that cannot answer never looks idle — and never marks the node's telemetry fresh.
- The GTT half of an APU's capacity is an aperture the GPU may map, not memory reserved for it: the CPU is using most of it, and `memory.total_bytes` counts the same RAM. Treat an APU's `vram_bytes` as a ceiling, not as free memory.
- `temperature_celsius` is the **edge** sensor. The same hwmon usually also exposes `junction` (hotspot) and `mem`, which read considerably hotter; edge is the closest analogue to `nvidia-smi`'s `temperature.gpu`, so rows stay comparable across vendors. With no labels at all, `temp1` is used.
- Power (`power1_input`) and clocks are exposed by the same hwmon but are not part of this wire contract.
- A host with no AMD card costs one `os.ReadDir` of `/sys/class/drm` per tick and logs nothing; a host without `/sys/class/drm` at all logs one `Debug` line for the process lifetime.

## Shutdown

The service shuts down on:

- stdin EOF (parent process closed the pipe)
- `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`

On shutdown it gracefully stops the HTTP/HTTPS listeners (3 s timeout).
