# nvpair-workload-manager

## Purpose

Propagates inference-workload lifecycle events across the cluster, so every node
has the same view of what work is queued, running, or finished — and on which
node. That shared view is what makes the Jobs list meaningful on any member and
what supplies the pending-work side of `nvpair-job-scheduler`'s GPU-aware
ranking.

The manager is a **relay and deduplicator**, not the source of truth. The broker
and proxies decide a workload's state; this component passes `workloadInfo`
through opaquely and forwards it.

## Communication

Two channels:

- **Local** — bidirectional newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 with the supervising
  `nvpair-ui-broker`. Stdio by default; `--ipc <path>` switches to a Unix domain
  socket or Windows named pipe.
- **Inter-node** — a cluster-mTLS server on port `14320`
  (`POST /v1/workloads/events`) that accepts the same JSON-RPC frames from pinned
  peers, plus an outbound broadcaster that pushes local events to those peers with
  bounded retry.

Peers are discovered through the broker's node records rather than by this
component browsing the network itself.

## CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port <n>` | `14320` | Inter-node port to listen on and advertise |
| `--ipc <path>` | _(stdio)_ | IPC endpoint: Unix socket or Windows named pipe |
| `--cluster-dir <path>` | _(none)_ | Cluster config dir (`node.crt` / `node.key` + `trusted/`) supplying the identity and pins the inter-node mTLS channel requires. Without it the node has no cluster identity and exchanges no inter-node traffic |
| `--log-level <level>` | `info` | One of `error` / `warn` / `info` / `debug` |
| `--version` | | Print version and exit |

## Transport security

The inter-node interface is **always cluster mTLS**. There is no plaintext
personality on it. The listener presents this node's cluster certificate,
requires a client certificate, and refuses any caller that is not a pinned
cluster peer with `403`. Pins are re-read per request, so removing a member takes
effect immediately without a restart.

A node that is not a current cluster member has no identity to present, so it
neither serves nor broadcasts inter-node workload traffic at all. The port stays
bound: the certificate is resolved per handshake, so a node converges to serving
after it joins without a rebind or a restart.

Workload state is therefore only ever exchanged between paired members. See the
repository [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) for the surrounding trust
boundaries.

## Local ingress (optional, loopback only)

A third-party producer on the same machine — an external scheduler, a local
inference harness that routes around the proxies — can report its workloads so
they appear in every member's Jobs list and count in the scheduler's pending
work for the node that runs them. The ingress is **off by default** and
**never leaves loopback**:

- Enable it with `--local-ingress 127.0.0.1:14324`, or, when the broker
  launches this worker without the flag, with `<appdir>/workload-ingress.json`
  containing `{"listen": "127.0.0.1:14324"}` (file-registered, like an engine
  manifest under `<appdir>/engines/`). A non-loopback address is refused at
  startup; a port already in use fails startup loudly.
- `POST /v1/workloads/events` takes the same JSON-RPC 2.0 frames as the
  inter-node port: `workload:submitted` / `workload:started` /
  `workload:completed` / `workload:errored` with `params.workloadInfo`, and
  `workloads:remove` with `params.workloadId`. A broker that cannot be written
  is `500`.
- The request is checked before its body is read, in this order: a method other
  than `POST` is `405`; a `Host` that is not a loopback name or address
  (`localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`) carrying the ingress port is `421`, which
  is what a DNS-rebinding page sends; any `Origin` header is `403`, because a
  browser adds one to a cross-origin request and a producer does not; a
  `Content-Type` other than `application/json` (parameters such as
  `charset=utf-8` are fine) is `415`; a body over 1 MiB is `413`.
- The frame is checked as an untrusted producer's, and a mistake is `400`:
  - `originatedFrom` (inside `params.workloadInfo` for a lifecycle frame, at the
    top level of `params` for `workloads:remove`) may be absent, `null`, empty or
    this node's UUID, and is stamped with this node's UUID when empty. Any other
    value is refused: the ingress reports workloads that run on this node.
  - `workloadInfo.state` is one of `initializing`, `queued`, `running`,
    `completed` or `failed`.
  - `workloadInfo.id` and `workloadId` are at most 256 bytes.
  - Field names are spelled exactly as documented. The JSON decoders match names
    without regard to case, so a name such as `originatedfrom` or `Id`, or two
    keys that differ only by case, is refused.
  - `resync`, in any spelling, is refused: it is the peers' own re-assertion
    marker, and a frame carrying it would bypass their dedup.
- An accepted frame is treated as **local origin**: tracked for re-sync,
  broadcast to pinned peers, and emitted to the broker as `workloads:upsert` /
  `workloads:remove` — the same translation a peer-origin event receives, so
  the local store, the Jobs list, the persisted history and the scheduler all
  update.

The trust boundary is the one the proxies' plaintext loopback personality
already documents: a process that can reach this machine's loopback may report
work, just as it may already submit it. A web page in the user's browser is not
such a process: the Host, Origin and content-type rules above refuse it before
its body is read. Prompts, messages and response bodies are not part of the
frame and must never be added.

## Lifecycle events

Inbound lifecycle notifications, on either channel:

| Method | Resulting state |
| --- | --- |
| `workload:submitted` | `queued` |
| `workload:started` | `running` |
| `workload:completed` | `completed` |
| `workload:errored` | `failed` |

Each carries `params.workloadInfo`. Removal uses `workloads:remove` with
`params.workloadId` and the origin `params.originatedFrom`.

## Workload shape

Defined in [`workload.go`](workload.go):

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Stable workload identifier |
| `model`, `engine` | What was requested and by which engine |
| `runId` | Optional grouping key |
| `state` | `initializing`, `queued`, `running`, `completed`, or `failed` |
| `originatedFrom` | Node the request entered the cluster on |
| `scheduledOn` | Node it was routed to; absent until a target is chosen |
| `createdAt`, `startedAt`, `completedAt` | Epoch milliseconds; the last two are nullable |
| `error` | Normalized failure text, nullable |
| `requesterId` | Optional client attribution, nullable |

Optional and nullable fields use pointers so a peer's payload round-trips without
inventing zero values.

Prompts, messages, and response bodies are **not** part of this contract and must
never be added to it.

## Output to the broker

Translated remote events are forwarded to the broker as:

| Notification | Params |
| --- | --- |
| `workloads:upsert` | `{ workloadInfo }` |
| `workloads:remove` | `{ workloadId, originatedFrom }` |
| `ready` | `{ version }` — startup handshake |

Duplicate events arriving from more than one peer are collapsed before they reach
the broker, so a workload observed over several paths is reported once.
